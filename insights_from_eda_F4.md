**Final EDA conclusion:**

Longer sales cycles strongly increase the risk of deal loss, making timely follow-ups and faster closures critical for improving win rates.

**factors that i compared to bring this conclusion are listed below:**

**Group deals by created date and closed date**

Deal creation shows seasonal spikes around March, which may align with new budgets and fresh sales activity. 

Anyways, these spikes do not consistently translate into higher deal closures, indicating challenges later in the sales process.

**Group deals by sales_rep_id and calculate win vs loss count**

The drop in win rate appears to be driven by consistent losses across most sales reps rather than failure by a small subset of the team.

this analysis helps us to study the top performers and can provide targeted coaching to underperforming reps.

**Group deals by region and calculate win rate**

The win rate decline is happening across all regions, which means improving sales processes and execution will likely have a bigger impact than focusing on any single market.

**Group deals by product_type and calculate win rate**

The win rate decline is consistent across product types, pointing to execution challenges rather than product-related issues.

**Group deals by deal_type and calculate win rate**

The largest deal drop-offs happen in the early and middle stages of the funnel, pointing to qualification and value communication issues rather than last-minute closing problems.

**outcome based on Amount**

The distribution of deal amounts is similar for won and lost deals, suggesting that deal size alone does not drive win rate. 

larger deals show higher variability and are more likely to be lost, indicating that high-value deals require stronger qualification and sales execution.

Don’t avoid large deals — manage them differently.
Flag high-value deals early and assign stronger reps or tighter follow-ups.

**outcome based on Sales cycle days**

Won deals have significantly shorter sales cycles compared to lost deals. Deals that remain open for longer durations are much more likely to be lost, indicating that prolonged sales cycles are a strong indicator of deal failure.

Introduce a sales-cycle threshold (for example, X days).
If a deal crosses it without progress → escalate, re-qualify, or close it.

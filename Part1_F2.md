**Problem Framing :**

1. What do you think is the real business problem here?

The business problem is CRO doesn't understand why win rate drops despite having a healthy pipeline . this lack of clarity makes it hard to decide whether the issue is with deal quality , market segment , sales exceution or internal processes. 
we haev to analyse the root cause so that any actions ca be taken by the team . 

2. What key questions should an AI system answer for the CRO?

the ystem should answer where and why deals are failing . The system shoould answer which types of deals are most likely to be lost , Are certain sales reps, regions, industries, or lead sources underperforming , which current open deals are most at risk of being lost, and where should the team focus attention to improve outcomes?

3. What metrics matter most for diagnosing win rate issues?

Win rate is obviously important, but it matters more when it’s broken down by sales rep, industry, lead source, and product type. 
How long a deal takes to close is also a big signal, because deals that drag on usually don’t end well. 
It’s also useful to see where deals are dropping off in the sales stages. 
Comparing deal sizes for won and lost deals can help show if pricing or deal quality is part of the problem.

4. What assumptions are you making about the data or business?

the assumptions that i make , sales data is mostly correct . the problem is to understand the deal lose rate . it might be bcuz of unclosed deals , or the follow up of those deals are not made by the sales rep . The regional difference where the sales / deals are made can impact the success of the deal .  the patterns from past deals are useful and can help guide better sales decisions going forward.
